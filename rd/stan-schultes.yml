  ## Bio
  Hi, I'm Stan Schultes, Chief Architect at innovation firm Spark Growth, based on the beautiful west coast of Florida.
  I'm an innovation consultant, solutions architect and developer, speaker, author, and problem solver. Not constrained
  by traditional ways of thinking, I'm an expert in Strategic Doing (from the Purdue Agile Strategies Lab), using agile
  strategies to help solve complex problems and to design, build and deploy resilient solutions that work nonstop.

  With a broad background implementing enterprise solutions in what I call IDEAS (Innovation, Design and Engineering
  Automation Systems), I've built large-scale systems that run worldwide. I have years of  experience in commercializing
  new technology and managing tech transfer into production scale. As an entrepreneur and professional technologist, I
  have led developer teams from the Fortune 200 to stewardship of several startups.

  My current interests lie in working with civic decision makers on Smart Cities concepts, Innovation Districts
  development, data analytics and integrating Internet of Everything solutions. In one of my current projects, I
  co-produce Smart Cities Innovation Accelerators with the Innovators' Forum, an initiative out of Harvard TECH.
  In the accelerators, we convene city decision makers from 25-30 cities at a time for intensive hands-on workshops
  to create and refine their strategies and smart city action plans. I'm also the corporate partnerships director,
  inviting and working with select industry-leading partner companies to contribute their knowledge and expertise
  to the problem solving process.

  I have long nurtured a passion for creating community engagement between entrepreneurs, investors, and educational
  resources, and helping early stage companies grow. I'm co-founder of the Spark Growth Leaders' Exchange (annually
  convening global thought leaders), and the community-focused DaVinci's Faire and BarCamp. I founded and run SarasotaDev,
  a .NET Developers group for the past 15 years, and the Entrepreneurs and Startups meetup. I work actively with the
  Manatee Chamber Downtown Redevelopment Committee and have served on the Suncoast Technology Forum Board of Directors
  and Florida High Tech Corridor Core Council.

  I'm certified in Business Incubator Management by the InBIA and co-founded Station 2 Innovation - a cowork-to-incubation
  and entrepreneur education center. I've been an MVP since 2004 specializing in developer productivity through Developer
  Tools & Languages, with Azure and Data Platform on the side. I've spoken at dozens of Code Camps, developer conferences,
  and have produced many MSDN webcasts and Channel9 videos on developer tools topics. I'm a former Contributing Editor and
  the Getting Started columnist, originally at VB Programmers Journal, which later became Visual Studio Magazine.

  Talk to me about: strategic leadership, innovation processes, solutions architecture, systems integration, cloud services
  architecture and data analytics application development, Smart Cities and IoT strategy, community building,
  entrepreneurial mindset, startup sustainability, economic development, public speaking, book authoring.
