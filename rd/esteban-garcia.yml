  ## Bio
  I am the Founder and Chief Technologist at [Nebbia Technology](https://www.NebbiaTech.com), 
  a consulting company focused on helping companies succeed with Azure while implementing DevOps 
  best practices.  I started the company knowing that companies looking to get to the cloud could 
  get there by having a solid DevOps practice in place.  I partner closely with customers, helping 
  them create a sustainable cloud roadmap, anchored by empowering teams to deliver 
  measurable value to the business.
  
  My background is in software development, with over 20 years of building enterprise software 
  and delivering technology solutions helping companies delivery value to their customers early 
  and often.  I value working software in production and creating feedback mechanisms that 
  allow teams to learn from their users and quickly iterate to deliver to end-users.
  
  I have been awarded the Microsoft ALM MVP award since 2012.  I have a passion for sharing 
  with the community through public speaking, teaching, and mentoring.  I speak frequently at 
  industry conferences, such as Ignite, VSLive, DevOps Days, PuppetConf, our very successful 
  [Orlando Code Camp](http://orlandocodecamp.com), and many others.  I am a 
  [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/esteban-garcia) author, with courses in 
  VSTS, Azure, testing, and general DevOps concepts.  Until 2018, I was the 
  president of the [Orlando .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/onetug/) for almost 10 years 
  and I am currently running [Orlando DevOps](https://www.meetup.com/orlando-devops/), along 
  with being active in other groups in Florida.
